# EskwelabsCapstone
ABSTRACT
This is my first data science capstone project and my capstone project as a Data Science Fellow at Eskwelabs. The project is about predicting sales demand of a new product in Amazon by comparing it to similar products that has sales data. We mapped the products into a vector space using TFIDF and used cosine similarity to identify products that are similar to the input product (the new product). Using the similar products as data points, we then experimented using multiple ensemble models like Random Forest and XGBoost to consrtruct a model that can predict the sales of the new product.
